# Online Shop - Unit Testing, Code Corrections and Implementation of Additional Features
Source Control Repository for a Software Development and Quality Assurance Assignment. I was provided with an ASP.NET Core MVC online retail shop with errors in the code. Unit Testing with XUnit, NUnit and Selenium was conducted, alongside a functional testing table to identify and correct the present errors.
Once these errors were corrected, I implemented the following additional features to the solution:
- Pagination, with sorting by Price and Name, with the ability to search for products by their descriptions
- Order History for Customers to view their orders, and to check the order status
- Amended checkout to auto-fill the email, forename and surname from the signed in account, and display the items the customer is ordering 
- Changed styling of the login and register Microsoft Identity pages used within the solution
